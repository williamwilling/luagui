Lua GUI
=======

Lua GUI is a library for creating GUIs with Lua aimed at unexperienced programmers. The library is being developed with the following goals in mind.

* Easy to use.
* Using conventions common to Lua. (It shouldn't feel like a wrapper around, for example, a C++ library.)

Installation
--------------

Just put the entire contents of the src-folder somewhere that's in Lua's package path.

If you are using [ZeroBrane Studio](http://studio.zerobrane.com/) and you have [Brane Plug](https://github.com/williamwilling/braneplug) installed, you can use that package manager to download and install Lua GUI.

Documentation
-------------

You can find a reference manual and code samples on the [wiki](https://github.com/williamwilling/luagui/wiki).

Lua GUI is licensed under the terms of the [Open Software License 3.0](http://opensource.org/licenses/OSL-3.0). You should read the entire license text, but here is the gist.

* You can use the Lua GUI source code as is for pretty much any purpose you want.
* You can create an application that uses Lua GUI and release your application under whatever terms you like.
* If you modify Lua GUI in any way, you must release the source code of your modifications under the Open Software License 3.0.
* Don't pretend you wrote Lua GUI.
* Don't blame me when something goes wrong.
